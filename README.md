Communauto Bookmarklet
======================

This was a mini-project to introduce myself to bookmarklets, jquery and node. It has this
practical use to show the car numbers on the Communauto listing. 

One Goal
--------

The Communauto bookmarklet only does one thing: show the car numbers in the 
availability report or reservervation grid. These were recently removed and while it is
still possible to know the numbers for the cars that were unreserved (by hovering the mouse
over the link and analyzing the URI), this bookmarklet simplifies the task. It changes
the 'Select' labels of all the available cars to include its corresponding number.

Hence there is no more guessing the car numbers. We can pick our favorite car just as
before.

How to use
----------

Go to this link and follow the instructions. It's dead simple. You just need to drag and drop
a link to your bookmark browser bar. This will create the bookmarklet.

Supported
---------

Only Chrome has been tested with so far. Bookmarlets should work across all modern browsers 
though. If you have a bug or want to request support for your favorite browser, open an issue.

Suggestions
-----------

I think there many improvement the Communauto website could use. If you have think so, and have
an idea, open an issue and we could have it done.

    <h2>Communauto Bookmarklet</h2>
    <p>This was a mini-project to introduce myself to bookmarklets, jquery and 
        node. It has this practical use to show the car numbers on the 
        Communauto listing.</p>

    <h3>One Goal</h3>
    <p>The Communauto bookmarklet only does one thing: show the car numbers in 
        the 'Availability Report' or 'Reservervation Grid' pages. These were 
        recently removed and while it is still possible to know the numbers for
        the cars that were unreserved (by hovering the mouse over the link and 
        analyzing the URI), this bookmarklet simplifies the task. It adds the 
        car number next to the 'Select' links for every availability.</p>

    <p>Hence there is no more guessing the car numbers. We can pick our favorite 
        car just as before.</p>

    <h3>How to install</h3>
    <h3>Communauto Bookmarklet Installation</h3>
    <p>To install the bookmarklet, drag and drop this
    <script type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[
    var linkster = "javascript:(function(){var head=document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0],script=document.createElement('script');script.type='text/javascript';script.src='https://raw.github.com/jimleroyer/communauto-bookmarklet/master/src/show-car-id.js?' + Math.floor(Math.random()*99999);head.appendChild(script);})(); void 0";
    linkster = '<a href="' + linkster + '">Communauto Bookmarklet</a>';
    document.write(linkster);
    // ]]&gt;</script>
     to your bookmark bar.
    </p>

    <h3>How to use</h3>
    <p>Once you have the bookmarklet loaded in your bookmark bar, login to the 
        Communauto page, do your operations as usual. But once you get in 
        either the 'Availability Report' or 'Reservation Grid' pages, hit the 
        'Communauto Bookmarklet' button (or menu). This will execute Javascript 
        code that will display the car numbers next to the 'Select' links. This 
        only applies for cars that were not reserved yet, as the car number is 
        not available on the client-side (i.e. in the browser) for already 
        reserved cars.</p>

    <h3>Supported</h3>
    <p>Only Chrome has been tested with so far. Bookmarlets should work across 
        all modern browsers though. If you have a bug or want to request 
        support for your favorite browser, open an issue on the 
        <a href="https://github.com/jimleroyer/communauto-bookmarklet">project 
            page</a>.</p>

    <h3>Suggestions</h3>
    <p>There are many improvement the Communauto website could use. If you 
        think so too, and have an idea, open an issue on the 
        <a href="https://github.com/jimleroyer/communauto-bookmarklet">project 
            page</a>.</p>
